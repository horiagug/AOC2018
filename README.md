# AOC2018

This repo contains some solutions to the advent of code puzzles for 2018 written in python.

More information can be found here https://adventofcode.com/

## How to run

So far no dependancies are required, so as long as you have python installed (I'm using python3.7) you should be able to run these scripts with:

```
python AOC_1.py
```

### Notes

These scripts are mostly done as a fun exercise so they might not be as optimal as they can get.
